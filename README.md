# firrtl
#### Flexible Internal Representation for RTL

 This repository contains the compiler for .fir files. It is in ALPHA VERSION, so many things may change in the coming months.
 There are two implementations, one in stanza and one in scala.

#### Installation Instructions
*Disclaimer*: This project is in alpha, so there is no guarantee anything works.

##### For Linux:
 1. Clone the repository:
 `git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/firrtl`
 1. Install lit (you need to have pip installed first):
 `pip install lit`
 1. Inflate stanza (this will fail before it builds firrtl):
 `make build`
 1. Remove first empty line in `utils/bin/stanza`, so the first line now becomes `#!/bin/bash`.
 1. Actually build firrtl:
 `make build`
 1. Run `make set-linux`, which links the FileCheck binary to the Linux version.
   * **Note**: This compiled binary may not run on all platforms. You may need to build
     Clang/LLVM from source to extract the compiled FileCheck utility.
 1. Add `firrtl/utils/bin` to your `PATH`, so that the compiled firrtl will be
 available anywhere. This also makes FileCheck available for the tests.
 1. Run tests:
 `make check`
   * **Note**: Stanza eats a üê£üê£üê£üê£ton of memory and running many instances
     simultaneously (as the build script does) may stall your system due to
     excessive paging. Setting a memory limit seems to make everything behave
     better: `ulimit -v 3096000`
 1. Build and test:
 `make`

##### For Mac:
 1. Clone the repository:
 `git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/firrtl`
 1. Install lit (you need to have pip installed first):
 `pip install lit`
 1. Build firrtl:
 `make build`
 1. Run `make set-osx`, which links the FileCheck binary to the Mac version.
 1. Run tests:
 `make check`
 1. Build and test:
 `make`

#### Scala implementation
The Scala FIRRTL implementation relies upon sbt 0.13.6. It uses sbt-assembly to create a fat JAR.
Using a bash script and a symbolic link it can be used with the same command-line arguments as the stanza implementation.
Example use:
  1. Build the fat JAR using the makefile: `make build-scala`, or using sbt: `sbt assembly`
    * For development, you can have sbt automatically monitor for changes and recompile: `sbt ~assembly`
  1. Link firrtl to the Scala version: `make set-scala` (can be reverted with `make set-stanza`)
  1. Scala firrtl can be invoked in the same way as Stanza firrtl (and the test
  make targets should continue to work):
  `./utils/bin/firrtl -i <input> -o <output> -X <compiler>`
